**In-situ Rainwater Harvesting and Agroecological Planning Model**  
*Participatory Demonstration and Evaluation System – Bismillah Initiative*

---

## 🌿 Introduction

This document outlines the structure, purpose, and interpretation of the **In-situ Agroecological Planning Machine Learning Model** developed to assist in local planning for water harvesting and crop-livestock integration across multiple regions — including **Palestine**, **Sudan**, **Bengal/Myanmar**, **Sahel**, **Swahili Coast**, and **Somalia**.

The model aims to generate **region-specific outlines** for sustainable interventions using:
- Locally available crops (sorghum, legumes, moringa, baobab, cactus, rice, etc.)
- Livestock integration (camels, goats, poultry, fish)
- Low-cost **in-situ rainwater harvesting** and **biofiltration** (e.g., pumpkin seed filtration)
- Participatory, farmer-led approaches validated under real field conditions

## ⚙️ Model Overview

The system uses a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on a small synthetic dataset to suggest suitable intervention strategies based on three primary environmental indicators:

| Feature | Description | Range |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| `WaterStress` | Drought severity (0–1 scale) | 0.35–0.95 |
| `SoilFertility` | Soil nutrient level proxy | 0.35–0.70 |
| `Accessibility` | Ease of logistics and community access | 0.40–0.65 |

Each region is labeled with a preferred **Intervention Type**, such as:
- *Tied Ridge + Legume Integration*  
- *Floating Rice Beds + Duck Integration*  
- *Cactus-Moringa Fodder + Sand Filter Harvesting*

The model learns correlations between these environmental indicators and possible interventions to provide adaptive planning suggestions.

## 🧪 Warnings Explained

When the model is run, you may see warnings such as:

### 🔍 What This Means
These warnings occur because:
- The dataset has **only six samples** (one per region).
- During model evaluation, some labels are **not present** in the small test subset.
- The metrics (precision, recall) are undefined for classes not predicted in that split.

This does **not mean the model failed** — only that evaluation metrics are incomplete due to limited data diversity.

### ✅ Resolution
In future datasets:
- Add more entries per region (≥50 data points recommended).  
- Ensure that all intervention types appear multiple times for statistical reliability.  
- Consider cross-validation rather than a simple train/test split.

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **`region_plans.csv`** | Contains per-region recommended interventions, water harvesting methods, and crop-livestock combinations |

## 💡 Strengths of the Model

- **Low computational cost** – runs entirely offline within a Jupyter Notebook.  
- **Regionally adaptable** – can integrate local datasets from NGOs or ministries.  
- **Participatory potential** – suitable for training workshops and field schools.  
- **Interdisciplinary bridge** – merges agronomy, hydrology, and AI planning.

## ⚠️ Weaknesses and Limitations

1. **Tiny Dataset**
   - Only six samples → statistical metrics unreliable.
   - Does not yet capture temporal (seasonal) or social variables.

2. **Synthetic Labels**
   - Intervention names were expert-derived but not field-validated through experiments.

3. **Simplified Ecology**
   - Soil fertility and water stress represented as single numeric values, whereas actual systems depend on soil texture, topography, vegetation index, and rainfall pattern.

4. **Overfitting Risk**
   - Random Forests can overfit when trained on extremely small datasets.

5. **Improvement Roadmap**
   - Collect real agronomic and socio-economic data (yield, rainfall, water salinity).
   - Implement **multi-objective modeling** (yield + resilience + cost).  
   - Partner with **local agricultural universities and research centers** for validation (e.g., Mechara ARC, Sudanese Agricultural Research, ICARDA, BRRI, etc.).
