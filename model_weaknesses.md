# Model Weaknesses & Limitations

**Date generated:** 2025-10-27 10:56:48.668745

This ML-driven planner is a demonstration/proof-of-concept. Important weaknesses to consider before operational use:

1. **Synthetic training labels:** The model was trained on labels generated by heuristic rules (not on field-validated outcomes). This introduces circular reasoning and potential bias toward the heuristics used to create the labels.
2. **Small and simplified feature set:** The features (WaterStress, SoilFertility, Accessibility) are coarse proxies. They omit critical variables such as soil texture, salinity, local social networks, market access, exact rainfall patterns, water quality, and land tenure.
3. **Regional heterogeneity ignored:** Each "Region" aggregates diverse micro-climates and socio-economic contexts. Plans should be downscaled and validated per community or watershed.
4. **No temporal dynamics:** The model does not model seasonality or multi-year effects (e.g., progressive soil recovery, pest pressure fluctuations).
5. **Intervention interactions not modeled:** Synergies and trade-offs between interventions (e.g., aquaculture may raise salinity) are not explicitly simulated.
6. **Data scarcity & sample size:** Training data are synthetic and limited; model performance metrics (accuracy ~ 1.00) reflect only synthetic test splits, not real-world predictive power.
7. **No causal inference:** The model does not infer causality—only correlational patterns in synthetic data.
8. **Operational constraints missing:** Costs, labor availability, cultural acceptance, supply chains for seeds, and local regulations are not included.
9. **Risk of over-reliance:** Stakeholders must avoid treating ML output as a final decision—treat it as a prioritized checklist for field evaluation.
10. **Ethical considerations:** Possible unintended consequences (land grabbing, inequitable distribution) must be addressed in participatory planning.

**Recommended next steps to strengthen the model:**

- Collect ground truth data from pilot sites (soil tests, yields, measured NTU and microbial water quality after pumpkin filtration, labor inputs, costs).
- Expand feature set to include market access, gender-disaggregated labor data, exact rainfall time-series, and water quality indicators.
- Use multi-label models (rather than single-label) to capture combined interventions.
- Incorporate temporal simulation (agent-based or system dynamics) for long-term planning.
- Validate model recommendations through participatory field trials and iterate on labels.
