Palestine,pumpkin_seed_filtration,"Olive, Chickpea, Moringa, Goat","Distribute household pumpkin-seed filtration kits (small jar-based slow filtration using crushed, roasted pumpkin seed layer + cloth prefilter). Include training on weekly seed replacement and solar pasteurization as backup. Suitable where sand filters or ceramic filters are unavailable.","Focus on terracing, smallholder olive regeneration, and goat manure recycling.",0.6,0.5,0.6
Sudan,tied_ridge_crop_integration,"Sorghum, Baobab, Groundnut, Camel","Implement tied-ridge in-situ water harvesting (30cm x 30cm tied ridges at 3m intervals) integrating drought staples like sorghum/millet, interplanted with legumes (cowpea/groundnut) and shade trees (baobab/moringa).
